abstract: Time difference of arrival (TDoA) localization with ultra-wideband (UWB) radios is rapidly gaining interest. Nevertheless, TDoA requires tightly time-synchronized anchors, either via wireless synchronization in small-scale setups with all anchors in range or via expensive wired backbones, both ultimately hampering the use of TDoA in large-scale areas.<br>In this paper we present TALLA, a novel wireless-only TDoA approach able to scale over large operational areas without sacrificing positioning accuracy. TALLA relies on a TDMA schedule enabling continuous, multi-hop operation of the anchor infrastructure. We evaluate TALLA in our 12-node UWB testbed and in much larger (>100 anchors) simulated areas, empowered by a technique that generates synthetic timing information faithfully reproducing the trends of the real one. Our real and simulated results show that TALLA achieves decimeter-level accuracy while tracking a moving target across several hops.
