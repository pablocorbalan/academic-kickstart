abstract: We present our Contiki port supporting the ultra-wideband (UWB) DW1000 transceiver directly on the popular DecaWave EVB1000 platform. Our port enables us to easily adapt and leverage the results of a decade of research on wireless sensor networks (WSNs), while exploiting the specific capabilities of UWB. Experimental results with our port confirm decimeter-level ranging accuracy as well as the feasibility of running unmodified Contiki Collect atop UWB.
